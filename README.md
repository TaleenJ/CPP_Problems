Program1:
With Breadth-first search to simulate how fire spreads through a forest grid and computes the minimum number of days required to burn all healthy trees, or returns −1 if it’s impossible.

Program2:
Finds the cheapest route between two cities with at most **k** stops by building a graph and using a BFS-style search with cost tracking to minimize total travel price.
